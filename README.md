# Rust Book Code Snippets

This is a collection of excercises from the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
which I went through and played with that code alongside reading through the book. It
contains most significant of the examples presented in the book, some as-is, while others
have been modified, or extended, to satisfy my learning curiosity and trying the extra
possibilities of the language.

This is mostly intended to be a self-reference, but if anyone finds it interesting you
may freely use it for your own reference.
